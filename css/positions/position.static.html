<p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is 
always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. Top, left, right and bottom does not work in case of static position</p>
